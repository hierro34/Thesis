	abstract = {In this work we propose a stabilized finite element method that permits us to circumvent discrete inf--sup conditions, e.g. allowing equal order interpolation. The type of method we propose belongs to the family of symmetric stabilization techniques, which are based on the introduction of additional terms that penalize the difference between some quantities, i.e. the pressure gradient in the {Stokes} problem, and their finite element projections. The key feature of the formulation we propose is the definition of the projection to be used, a non-standard {Scott--Zhang} projector that is well-defined for L 1 ( Ω ) functions. The resulting method has some appealing features: the projector is local and nested meshes or enriched spaces are not required.},

The motivation of this method relies on the analysis of a class of fractional-step methods for the Navier-{Stokes} equations for which it is known that equal interpolations yield good numerical results. The reason for this turns out to be the difference between two discrete Laplacian operators computed in a different manner. The formulation of the {Stokes} problem considered here aims to reproduce this effect. From the analysis of the finite element approximation of the problem we obtain stability and optimal error estimates using velocity-pressure interpolations satisfying a compatibility condition much weaker than the inf-sup condition of the standard formulation. In particular, this condition is fulfilled by the most common equal order interpolations.},

	abstract = {In this article, we propose different splitting procedures for the transient incompressible magnetohydrodynamics ({MHD)} system that are unconditionally stable. We consider two levels of splitting, on one side we perform the segregation of the fluid pressure and magnetic pseudo-pressure from the vectorial fields computation. At the second level, the fluid velocity and induction fields are also decoupled. This way, we transform a fully coupled indefinite multi-physics system into a set of smaller definite ones, clearly reducing the {CPU} cost. With regard to the finite element approximation, we stick to an unconditionally convergent stabilized finite element formulation because it introduces convection stabilization, allows to circumvent inf-sup conditions (clearly simplifying implementation issues), and is able to capture non-smooth solutions of the magnetic subproblem. However, residual-based finite element formulations are not suitable for segregation, because they lose the skew-symmetry of the off-diagonal blocks. Therefore, in this work, we have proposed a novel term-by-term stabilization of the {MHD} system based on projections that is still unconditionally convergent.

We first prove that if a sequence of finite element solutions converges boundedly almost everywhere (as the mesh size tends to zero) to a function u, then u is an entropy solution of the conservation law. This result may be extended to systems of conservation laws with convex entropy in several dimensions. We then prove, using a compensated compactness result of Murat-Tartar, that if the finite element solutions are uniformly bounded then a subsequence will converge to an entropy solution of Burgers' equation. We also consider a further modification of the test functions giving a method with improved shock capturing. Finally, we present the results of some numerical experiments.},

The approach is based on local projections of the residual terms which are used in order to achieve consistency of the method, avoiding local evaluation of the strong form of the differential operator. We prove stability and give a priori and a posteriori error estimates. We show convergence of an iterative method which uses a simplified stabilized discretization as preconditioner. Numerical experiments indicate that the approach presented is at least as accurate as the original method, but offers some algorithmic advantages.

The key feature of the {FE} formulation resides in the design of the stabilization terms, which serve several purposes. First, the formulation is suitable for convection dominated flows. Second, there is no need to use interpolation spaces constrained to a compatibility condition in both sub-problems and therefore, equal-order interpolation spaces can be used for all the unknowns. Finally, this formulation leads to a coupled linear system; this monolithic approach is effective, since the coupling can be dealt by effective preconditioning and iterative solvers that allows to deal with high Hartmann numbers.},

For convection--diffusion-reaction problems, two methods are considered: residual based, isotropic diffusion and the previous nonlinear cross-wind diffusion factor supplemented by additional isotropic diffusion scaling as the square of the mesh size. Practical versions of the present methods suitable for numerical implementation are compared to previous discontinuity capturing schemes lacking theoretical justification.

These equations describe a wide range of wave propagation and transport phenomena arising in nearly every scientific and engineering discipline. Several applications are described in a self-contained manner, along with much of the mathematical theory of hyperbolic problems. High-resolution versions of Godunov's method are developed, in which Riemann problems are solved to determine the local wave structure and limiters are applied to eliminate numerical oscillations. The methods were orginally designed to capture shock waves accurately, but are also useful tools for studying linear wave-progagation problems, particulary in heterogenous material. The methods studied are in the {CLAWPACK} software package. Source code for all the examples presented can be found on the web, along with animations of many of the simulations. This provides an excellent learning environment for understanding wave propagation phenomena and finite volume methods.},

The study of nonclassical shock waves is based on the concept of a kinetic relation introduced by the author for general hyperbolic systems and derived from singular limits of hyperbolic conservation laws with balanced diffusion and dispersion terms. The systems of partial differential equations under consideration arise in many areas of continuum physics.

They combine a special class of {Runge--Kutta} time discretizations, that allows the method to be non-linearly stable regardless of its accuracy, with a finite element space discretization by discontinuous approximations, that incorporates the ideas of numerical fluxes and slope limiters coined during the remarkable development of the high-resolution finite difference and finite volume schemes.

An expression for this matrix is proposed for the case of general coupled systems of equations that is an extension of the expression proposed for a one-dimensional ({1D)} model problem. Applications of the stabilization technique to the {Stokes} problem with convection and to the bending of {Reissner--Mindlin} plates are discussed next.

The main methodological originality is that we replace the projection-stabilized structure by an interpolation-stabilized structure, with reduced computational cost for some choices of the interpolation operator. This stabilization has one level, in the sense that it is defined on a single mesh. We prove the stability of our formulation by means of a specific inf–sup condition, which is the main technical innovation of our paper. We perform a convergence and error estimates analysis, proving the optimal order of accuracy of our method. We include some numerical tests that confirm our theoretical expectations.},

Because of a similarity in their descriptive equations, procedures for constructing numerical models of these systems are also similar, and these similarities can be exploited. Moreover, using the latest technology, what were once difficult and expensive computations can now be done on desktop computers. This new edition of a highly successful book presents algorithms useful for reactive flow simulations, describes trade-offs involved in their use, and gives guidance for building and using models of complex reactive flows. It takes account of the explosive growth in computer technology and the greatly increased capacity for solving complex reactive-flow problems that has occurred since the previous edition was published more than fifteen years ago. An indispensable guide on how to construct, use, and interpret numerical simulations of reactive flows, this book will be welcomed by advanced undergraduate and graduate students, and a wide range of researchers and practitioners in engineering, physics, and chemistry.},
