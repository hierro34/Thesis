	abstract = {To avoid the local oscillations that still remain using the streamline-upwind/Petrov-Galerkin formulation for the scalar convection-diffusion equation, the introduction of a nonlinear crosswind dissipation is proposed. It is shown that the method is less overdiffusive than other discontinuity-capturing techniques and has better numerical behavior. The design of the crosswind diffusion is based on the study of the discrete maximum principle for some simple cases.},

	abstract = {Summary An algebraic approach to the design of multidimensional high-resolution schemes is introduced and elucidated in the finite element context. A centered space discretization of unstable convective terms is rendered local extremum diminishing by a conservative elimination of negative off-diagonal coefficients from the discrete transport operator. This modification leads to an upwind-biased low-order scheme which is nonoscillatory but overly diffusive. In order to reduce the incurred error, a limited amount of compensating antidiffusion is added in regions where the solution is sufficiently smooth. Two closely related flux correction strategies are presented. The first one is based on a multidimensional generalization of total variation diminishing (TVD) schemes, whereas the second one represents an extension of the FEM-FCT paradigm to implicit time-stepping. Nonlinear algebraic systems are solved by an iterative defect correction scheme preconditioned by the low-order evolution operator which enjoys the M-matrix property. The dffusive and antidiffusive terms are represented as a sum of antisymmetric internodal fluxes which are constructed edge-by-edge and inserted into the global defect vector. The new methodology is applied to scalar transport equations discretized in space by the Galerkin method. Its performance is illustrated by numerical examples for 2D benchmark problems.},

	abstract = {Flux correction in the finite element context is addressed. Criteria for positivity of the numerical solution are formulated, and the low-order transport operator is constructed from the discrete high-order operator by adding modulated dissipation so as to eliminate negative off-diagonal entries. The corresponding antidiffusive terms can be decomposed into a sum of genuine fluxes (rather than element contributions) which represent bilateral mass exchange between individual nodes. Thereby, essentially one-dimensional flux correction tools can be readily applied to multidimensional problems involving unstructured meshes. The proposed methodology guarantees mass conservation and makes it possible to design both explicit and implicit FCT schemes based on a unified limiting strategy. Numerical results for a number of benchmark problems illustrate the performance of the algorithm.},
