It is shown that the method is less overdiffusive than other discontinuity-capturing techniques and has better numerical behavior. The design of the crosswind diffusion is based on the study of the discrete maximum principle for some simple cases.},

	abstract = {Summary An algebraic approach to the design of multidimensional high-resolution schemes is introduced and elucidated in the finite element context. A centered space discretization of unstable convective terms is rendered local extremum diminishing by a conservative elimination of negative off-diagonal coefficients from the discrete transport operator. This modification leads to an upwind-biased low-order scheme which is nonoscillatory but overly diffusive. In order to reduce the incurred error, a limited amount of compensating antidiffusion is added in regions where the solution is sufficiently smooth. Two closely related flux correction strategies are presented. The first one is based on a multidimensional generalization of total variation diminishing (TVD) schemes, whereas the second one represents an extension of the FEM-FCT paradigm to implicit time-stepping. Nonlinear algebraic systems are solved by an iterative defect correction scheme preconditioned by the low-order evolution operator which enjoys the M-matrix property. The dffusive and antidiffusive terms are represented as a sum of antisymmetric internodal fluxes which are constructed edge-by-edge and inserted into the global defect vector. The new methodology is applied to scalar transport equations discretized in space by the Galerkin method. Its performance is illustrated by numerical examples for 2D benchmark problems.},

	abstract = {Flux correction in the finite element context is addressed. Criteria for positivity of the numerical solution are formulated, and the low-order transport operator is constructed from the discrete high-order operator by adding modulated dissipation so as to eliminate negative off-diagonal entries. The corresponding antidiffusive terms can be decomposed into a sum of genuine fluxes (rather than element contributions) which represent bilateral mass exchange between individual nodes. Thereby, essentially one-dimensional flux correction tools can be readily applied to multidimensional problems involving unstructured meshes. The proposed methodology guarantees mass conservation and makes it possible to design both explicit and implicit FCT schemes based on a unified limiting strategy. Numerical results for a number of benchmark problems illustrate the performance of the algorithm.},

	title = {Numerical {Solution} of {Time}-{Dependent} {Advection}-{Diffusion}-{Reaction} {Equations}},
	isbn = {978-3-662-09017-6},
	abstract = {This book deals with numerical methods for solving partial differential equa tions (PDEs) coupling advection, diffusion and reaction terms, with a focus on time-dependency. A combined treatment is presented of methods for hy perbolic problems, thereby emphasizing the one-way wave equation, meth ods for parabolic problems and methods for stiff and non-stiff ordinary dif ferential equations (ODEs). With regard to time-dependency we have at tempted to present the algorithms and the discussion of their properties for the three different types of differential equations in a unified way by using semi-discretizations, i. e. , the method of lines, whereby the PDE is trans formed into an ODE by a suitable spatial discretization. In addition, for hy perbolic problems we also discuss discretizations that use information based on characteristics. Due to this combination of methods, this book differs substantially from more specialized textbooks that deal exclusively with nu merical methods for either PDEs or ODEs. We treat integration methods suitable for both classes of problems. This combined treatment offers a clear advantage. On the one hand, in the field of numerical ODEs highly valuable methods and results exist which are of practical use for solving time-dependent PDEs, something which is often not fully exploited by numerical PDE researchers. Although many problems can be solved by Euler's method or the Crank-Nicolson method, better alter natives are often available which can significantly reduce the computational effort needed to solve practical problems.},
