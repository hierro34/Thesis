	abstract = {Finite element methods approximate solutions of partial differential equations by restricting the problem to a finite dimensional function space. In hp adaptive finite element methods, one defines these discrete spaces by choosing different polynomial degrees for the shape functions defined on a locally refined mesh. Although this basic idea is quite simple, its implementation in algorithms and data structures is challenging. It has apparently not been documented in the literature in its most general form. Rather, most existing implementations appear to be for special combinations of finite elements, or for discontinuous Galerkin methods. In this article, we discuss generic data structures and algorithms used in the implementation of hp methods for arbitrary elements, and the complications and pitfalls one encounters. As a consequence, we list the information a description of a finite element has to provide to the generic algorithms for it to be used in an hp context. We support our claim that our reference implementation is efficient using numerical examples in two dimensions and three dimensions, and demonstrate that the hp-specific parts of the program do not dominate the total computing time. This reference implementation is also made available as part of the Open Source deal.II finite element library.},

One- and Two-Dimensional Elliptic and Maxwell Problems presents 1D and 2D codes and automatic hp adaptivity. This self-contained source discusses the theory and implementation of hp-adaptive FE methods, focusing on projection-based interpolation and the corresponding hp-adaptive strategy.The book is split into three parts, progressing from simple to more advanced problems. Part I examines the hp elements for the standard 1D model elliptic problem. The author develops the variational formulation and explains the construction of FE basis functions. The book then introduces the 1D code (1Dhp) and automatic hp adaptivity. This first part ends with a study of a 1D wave propagation problem. In Part II, the book proceeds to 2D elliptic problems, discussing two model problems that are slightly beyond standard-level examples: 3D axisymmetric antenna problem for Maxwell equations (example of a complex-valued, indefinite problem) and 2D elasticity (example of an elliptic system). The author concludes with a presentation on infinite elements - one of the possible tools to solve exterior boundary-value problems. Part III focuses on 2D time-harmonic Maxwell equations. The book explains the construction of the hp edge elements and the fundamental de Rham diagram for the whole family of hp discretizations. Next, it explores the differences between the elliptic and Maxwell versions of the 2D code, including automatic hp adaptivity. Finally, the book presents 2D exterior (radiation and scattering) problems and sample solutions using coupled hp finite/infinite elements.In Computing with hp-ADAPTIVE FINITE ELEMENTS, the information provided, including many unpublished details, aids in solving elliptic and Maxwell problems.},

After a review of boundary-value problems, the book examines exact hp sequences, projection-based interpolation, and De Rham diagrams. It also presents the 3D version of the automatic hp-adaptivity package, a two-grid solver for highly anisotropic hp meshes and goal-oriented Krylov iterations, and a parallel implementation of the 3D code.The second part explores several recent projects in which the 3Dhp code was used and illustrates how these applications have greatly driven the development of 3D hp technology. It encompasses acoustic and electromagnetic (EM) scattering problems, an analysis of complex structures with thin-walled components, and challenging simulations of logging tools. The book concludes with a look at the future of hp methods.Spearheaded by a key developer of this technology with more than 20 years of research in the field, this self-contained, comprehensive resource will help readers overcome the difficulties in coding hp-adaptive elements.},

In the last decade the p-, hp-, and spectral element methods have emerged as efficient and robust approximation methods for several classes of problems in this area. The aim of this book is therefore to establish the exponential convergence of such methods for problems with the piecewise analytic solutions which typically arise in engineering. It looks at the variational formulation of boundary value problems with particular emphasis on the regularity of the solution. The books then studies the p- and hp- convergence of FEM in one and two dimensions, supplying complete proofs. Also covered are hp-FEM for saddle point problems and the techniques for establishing the discrete infsup condition. Finally, hp-FEM in solid mechanics and the issue of locking is addressed in the context of these methods.},

	abstract = {Adaptive refinement usually involves refining or enriching a fraction of mesh elements by one level based on a cut-off criterion, requiring several costly intermediate solutions before a mesh that yields an acceptable solution is obtained. We avoid this by formulating and solving the mesh design problem as a mathematical program. Our approach simultaneously modifies both mesh size (h) and local polynomial order (p) to yield an ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù mesh for a target error or given computational cost with gradients from local convergence rates. Constraints such as the one irregularity rule during mesh refinement are systematically incorporated in this formulation. The design task leads to a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP), that is relaxed to an NLP. To reduce the computations for the NLP, we employ simplified analytical gradients derived from initial mesh calculations. Finally, we apply our method to three model problems showing that complex hp-adaptive grids can be obtained directly from a uniform coarse grid.

The strategy for choosing an h - or p -enrichment for an element which is subject to a refinement in an adaptive method is not well understood; in particular, this is the most important open problem associated with h ‚Äì p -refinement. A mathematical derivation of a posteriori estimates for the error and the error reduction corresponding to an h - or p -refinement of elements is presented. The estimation of the error reduction uses the solution of local problems, the estimate is bounded by the true reduction from below and above with constants only depending on the differential operator. Based on these a posteriori estimates an adaptive algorithm is derived. Numerical results show the efficiency of the estimators for several problem classes. For the xŒ± model singularity the a priori known optimal h ‚Äì p mesh is obtained by this algorithm.},

Like adaptive refinement for the h version of the finite element method, a posteriori error estimates can be used to determine where the mesh needs to be refined, but a single error estimate can not simultaneously determine whether it is better to do the refinement by h or by p. Several strategies for making this determination have been proposed over the years.

In the MAFELAP context finite elements have always been interpreted in a broad and inclusive manner, including techniques such as finite difference, finite volume and boundary element methods as well as actual finite element methods. Twenty-six papers were carefully selected for this book out of the 180 presentations made at the conference, and all of these reflect this style and approach to finite elements. The increasing importance of modelling, in addition to numerical discretization, error estimation and adaptivity was also studied in MAFELAP 1999.},

	abstract = {The resolution of boundary layers typically requires fine grids in the wall normal direction, which leads to anisotropic elements being refined towards the wall. Best practice guidelines for the mesh generation of stretched boundary layer grids exist for the finite volume or finite difference discretizations. A similar resolution of boundary layers with DG schemes can be achieved with a coarser grid because of the subgrid resolution of the DG scheme. High order schemes incorporate the possibility of high order element mappings, resulting in different resolution properties inside the element. In this paper, we show that the use of an internal element mapping in combination with a stretched grid can be used to reduce the error of the boundary layer approximation by an order of magnitude in comparison with the classical linear internal element mapping. The boundary layer is modeled by a one-dimensional singular perturbation problem. In addition, we discuss the construction of the element mappings by interpolation and investigate the limits of the stretching function such that the resulting element Jacobian remains positive. A parameter study shows the influence of the element mapping for different polynomial degrees on the solution. Copyright ¬© 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The meshes are assumed to satisfy two standard conditions: a local quasi-uniformity property and the Xu-Zikatanov condition ensuring that the stiffness matrix associated with the Poisson equation is an -matrix. A discrete maximum principle is rigorously established in any space dimension for convection-diffusion-reaction problems. We prove that the shock-capturing finite element solution converges to that without shock-capturing if the cell P√©clet numbers are sufficiently small. Moreover, in the diffusion-dominated regime, the difference between the two finite element solutions super-converges with respect to the actual approximation error. Numerical experiments on test problems with stiff layers confirm the sharpness of the a priori error estimates.},

We derive nonlinear streamline and cross-wind diffusion methods that guarantee a discrete maximum principle for strictly acute meshes and first order polynomial interpolation. For pure convection‚Äìdiffusion problems, the discrete maximum principle is achieved using a nonlinear cross-wind diffusion factor that depends on the angle between the discrete solution and the flow velocity. For convection‚Äìdiffusion-reaction problems, two methods are considered: residual based, isotropic diffusion and the previous nonlinear cross-wind diffusion factor supplemented by additional isotropic diffusion scaling as the square of the mesh size. Practical versions of the present methods suitable for numerical implementation are compared to previous discontinuity capturing schemes lacking theoretical justification. Numerical results are investigated in terms of both solution quality (violation of maximum principle, smearing of internal layers) and computational costs.},

	abstract = {We consider a family of explicit one-step time discretizations for finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin schemes, which is based on a predictor-corrector formulation. The predictor remains local taking into account the time evolution of the data only within the grid cell. Based on a space‚Äìtime Taylor expansion, this idea is already inherent in the MUSCL finite volume scheme to get second order accuracy in time and was generalized in the context of higher order ENO finite volume schemes. We interpret the space‚Äìtime Taylor expansion used in this approach as a local predictor and conclude that other space‚Äìtime approximate solutions of the local Cauchy problem in the grid cell may be applied. Three possibilities are considered in this paper: (1) the classical space‚Äìtime Taylor expansion, in which time derivatives are obtained from known space-derivatives by the Cauchy‚ÄìKovalewsky procedure; (2) a local continuous extension Runge‚ÄìKutta scheme and (3) a local space‚Äìtime Galerkin predictor with a version suitable for stiff source terms. The advantage of the predictor‚Äìcorrector formulation is that the time evolution is done in one step which establishes optimal locality during the whole time step. This time discretization scheme can be used within all schemes which are based on a piecewise continuous approximation as finite volume schemes, discontinuous Galerkin schemes or the recently proposed reconstructed discontinuous Galerkin or PNPM schemes. The implementation of these approaches is described, advantages and disadvantages of different predictors are discussed and numerical results are shown.},

We show that the error on each element can be split into a dominant and less dominant component and that the leading part is O(hp+1) and is spanned by two (p+1)-degree Radau polynomials in the x and y directions, respectively. We show that the p-degree discontinuous finite element solution is superconvergent at Radau points obtained as a tensor product of the roots of (p+1)-degree Radau polynomial. For a linear model problem, the p-degree discontinuous Galerkin solution flux exhibits a strong O(h2p+2) local superconvergence on average at the element outflow boundary. We further establish an O(h2p+1) global superconvergence for the solution flux at the outflow boundary of the domain.

Generalizations to more general one-dimensional problems are straightforward, and the results also extend to higher space dimensions; but this involves some additional considerations.

In the present paper, the most promising of these SOLD methods are investigated in more detail for P 1 and Q 1 finite elements. In particular, the dependence of the results on the mesh, the data of the problems and parameters of the methods are studied analytically and numerically. Furthermore, the numerical solution of the nonlinear discrete problems is discussed and the capability of adaptively refined grids for reducing spurious oscillations is examined. Our conclusion is that, also for simple problems, any of the SOLD methods generally provides solutions with non-negligible spurious oscillations.},

Then, an artificial viscosity (AV) technique is designed for convection-dominant problems that satisfies the above mentioned DMP. The noncomplete stabilized interior penalty dG method is proved to fulfil the DMP property for the one-dimensional linear case when adding such AV with certain parameters.

	abstract = {In Vuik and Ryan (2014) we studied the use of troubled-cell indicators for discontinuity detection in nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations and introduced a new multiwavelet technique to detect troubled cells. We found that these methods perform well as long as a suitable, problem-dependent parameter is chosen. This parameter is used in a threshold which decides whether or not to detect an element as a troubled cell. Until now, these parameters could not be chosen automatically. The choice of the parameter has impact on the approximation: it determines the strictness of the troubled-cell indicator. An inappropriate choice of the parameter will result in detection (and limiting) of too few or too many elements. The optimal parameter is chosen such that the minimal number of troubled cells is detected and the resulting approximation is free of spurious oscillations. In this paper, we will see that for each troubled-cell indicator, the sudden increase or decrease of the indicator value with respect to the neighboring values is important for detection. Indication basically reduces to detecting the outliers of a vector (one dimension) or matrix (two dimensions). This is done using Tukey's boxplot approach to detect which coefficients in a vector are straying far beyond others (Tukey, 1977). We provide an algorithm that can be applied to various troubled-cell indication variables. Using this technique the problem-dependent parameter that the original indicator requires is no longer necessary as the parameter will be chosen automatically.},

This is done by taking advantage of the global expression of the DG method and re-expanding it in terms of a multiwavelet basis, which is a sum of the global average and finer details on different levels. Examining the higher level difference coefficients acts as a troubled-cell indicator, thus avoiding unnecessary increased computational cost of a new expansion. In two-dimensions the multiwavelet decomposition uses combinations of scaling functions and multiwavelets in the x- and y-directions for improved troubled-cell indication. By using such a troubled-cell indicator, we are able to reduce the computational cost by avoiding limiting in smooth regions. We present numerical examples in one- and two-dimensions and compare our troubled-cell indicator to the subcell resolution technique of Harten (1989) [11] and the shock detector of Krivodonova et al.

In this follow-up paper, we extend the method to solve two-dimensional problems. Although the main idea of the method for two-dimensional case is similar to that for one-dimensional case, the extension of the implementation of the method to two-dimensional case is nontrivial because of the complexity of the adaptive mesh with hanging nodes.

Prominent examples include plate and shell models for small thickness in solid mechanics, convection-diffusion problems in fluid mechanics, and equations arising in semi-conductor device modelling. Common features of these problems are layers and, in the case of non-smooth geometries, corner singularities. Mesh design principles for the efficient approximation of both features by the hp-version of the finite element method (hp-FEM) are proposed in this volume. For a class of singularly perturbed problems on polygonal domains, robust exponential convergence of the hp-FEM based on these mesh design principles is established rigorously.},

In this follow-up paper, we extend the method to solve two-dimensional problems.

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new global troubled-cell indicator for the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method in one- and two-dimensions. This is done by taking advantage of the global expression of the DG method and re-expanding it in terms of a multiwavelet basis, which is a sum of the global average and finer details on different levels. Examining the higher level difference coefficients acts as a troubled-cell indicator, thus avoiding unnecessary increased computational cost of a new expansion. In two-dimensions the multiwavelet decomposition uses combinations of scaling functions and multiwavelets in the x- and y-directions for improved troubled-cell indication. By using such a troubled-cell indicator, we are able to reduce the computational cost by avoiding limiting in smooth regions. We present numerical examples in one- and two-dimensions and compare our troubled-cell indicator to the subcell resolution technique of Harten (1989) [11] and the shock detector of Krivodonova et al.

The second is a sub-grid scale method, whose stabilization effect is very similar to that of the Galerkin/least-squares (GLS) method for the Stokes problem.

	abstract = {This paper proposes an explicit, (at least) second-order, maximum principle satisfying, Lagrange finite element method for solving nonlinear scalar conservation equations. The technique is based on a new viscous bilinear form introduced in Guermond and Nazarov [Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg., 272 (2014), pp. 198--213], a high-order entropy viscosity method, and the Boris--Book--Zalesak flux correction technique. The algorithm works for arbitrary meshes in any space dimension and for all Lipschitz fluxes. The formal second-order accuracy of the method and its convergence properties are tested on a series of linear and nonlinear benchmark problems.},

	abstract = {A class of linear elliptic operators has an important qualitative property, the so-called maximum principle. In this paper we investigate how this property can be preserved on the discrete level when an interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin method is applied for the discretization of a 1D elliptic operator. We give mesh conditions for the symmetric and for the incomplete method that establish some connection between the mesh size and the penalty parameter. We then investigate the sharpness of these conditions. The theoretical results are illustrated with numerical examples.},

In the present paper, the most promising of these SOLD methods are investigated in more detail for P 1 and Q 1 finite elements. In particular, the dependence of the results on the mesh, the data of the problems and parameters of the methods are studied analytically and numerically. Furthermore, the numerical solution of the nonlinear discrete problems is discussed and the capability of adaptively refined grids for reducing spurious oscillations is examined. Our conclusion is that, also for simple problems, any of the SOLD methods generally provides solutions with non-negligible spurious oscillations.},
