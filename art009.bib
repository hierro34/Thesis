	abstract = {Nonlinear constrained finite element approximations to anisotropic diffusion problems are considered. Starting with a standard (linear or bilinear) {Galerkin} discretization, the entries of the stiffness matrix are adjusted so as to enforce sufficient conditions of the discrete maximum principle ({DMP).} An algebraic splitting is employed to separate the contributions of negative and positive off-diagonal coefficients which are associated with diffusive and antidiffusive numerical fluxes, respectively. In order to prevent the formation of spurious undershoots and overshoots, a symmetric slope limiter is designed for the antidiffusive part. The corresponding upper and lower bounds are defined using an estimate of the steepest gradient in terms of the maximum and minimum solution values at surrounding nodes. The recovery of nodal gradients is performed by means of a lumped-mass L 2 projection. The proposed slope limiting strategy preserves the consistency of the underlying discrete problem and the structure of the stiffness matrix (symmetry, zero row and column sums). A positivity-preserving defect correction scheme is devised for the nonlinear algebraic system to be solved. Numerical results and a grid convergence study are presented for a number of anisotropic diffusion problems in two space dimensions.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0701},
	abstract = {Transient diffusion equations arise in many branches of engineering and applied sciences (e.g., heat transfer and mass transfer), and are parabolic partial differential equations. It is well-known that, under certain assumptions on the input data, these equations satisfy important mathematical properties like maximum principles and the non-negative constraint, which have implications in mathematical modeling. However, existing numerical formulations for these types of equations do not, in general, satisfy maximum principles and the non-negative constraint. In this paper, we present a methodology for enforcing maximum principles and the non-negative constraint for {\textbackslash}emph\{transient\} anisotropic diffusion equation. The method of horizontal lines (also known as the Rothe method) is applied in which the time is discretized first. This results in solving steady anisotropic diffusion equation with decay equation at every discrete time level, which is solved using the methodology that has been recently proposed by Nagarajan and Nakshatrala ({\textbackslash}{emph\{International} Journal for Numerical Methods in Fluids\}, vol. 67, pp.{\textasciitilde}820-847, 2011). The proposed methodology for {\textbackslash}emph\{transient\} anisotropic diffusion equation will satisfy maximum principles and the non-negative constraint on general computational grids, and with no additional restrictions on the time step. We illustrate the performance and accuracy of the proposed formulation using representative numerical examples. We also perform numerical convergence of the proposed methodology. For comparison, we also present the results from the standard single-field semi-discrete formulation and the results from a popular software package, which all will violate maximum principles and the non-negative constraint.},

	abstract = {The main aim of this paper is to document the performance of p-refinement with respect to maximum principles and the nonnegative constraint. The model problem is steady-state anisotropic diffusion with decay (which is a second-order elliptic partial differential equation). We consider the standard single-field formulation based on the {Galerkin} formalism and two least squares-based mixed formulations. We employ Lagrange polynomials with unequal-spaced points, and polynomials of order p = 1 to p = 10 are used. It is shown that the violation of the nonnegative constraint cannot be overcome with p-refinement alone for anisotropic diffusion. We shall illustrate the performance of p-refinement by using several representative problems. The intended outcomes of the paper are twofold. First, this study will caution the users of high-order approximations about their performance with respect to maximum principles and the nonnegative constraint. Second, this study will help researchers develop new methodologies for enforcing maximum principles and the nonnegative constraint under high-order approximations.

The finite element discretization of the flame equations involves least squares control of streamline derivatives and pressure–velocity coupling as well as a new shock capturing term based on nonlinear crosswind diffusion yielding a suitable discrete maximum principle for the discrete solution. A posteriori error estimates derived from the dual weighted residual method are used to refine the mesh adaptively. Numerical results are presented for a Bunsen flame with simple chemistry on locally refined as well as fully unstructured Delaunay meshes. Solution quality is evaluated in terms of overall flame characteristics – including length, lift off and width – as well as undershoots in species and temperature profiles.},

	abstract = {An algebraic approach to the design of multidimensional high-resolution schemes is introduced and elucidated in the finite element context. A centered space discretization of unstable convective terms is rendered local extremum diminishing by a conservative elimination of negative off-diagonal coefficients from the discrete transport operator. This modification leads to an upwind-biased low-order scheme which is nonoscillatory but overly diffusive. In order to reduce the incurred error, a limited amount of compensating antidiffusion is added in regions where the solution is sufficiently smooth. Two closely related flux correction strategies are presented. The first one is based on a multidimensional generalization of total variation diminishing ({TVD)} schemes, whereas the second one represents an extension of the {FEM-FCT} paradigm to implicit time-stepping. Nonlinear algebraic systems are solved by an iterative defect correction scheme preconditioned by the low-order evolution operator which enjoys the M-matrix property. The dffusive and antidiffusive terms are represented as a sum of antisymmetric internodal fluxes which are constructed edge-by-edge and inserted into the global defect vector. The new methodology is applied to scalar transport equations discretized in space by the {Galerkin} method. Its performance is illustrated by numerical examples for {2D} benchmark problems.},

It is well known that this particular equation is a second-order elliptic equation, and satisfies a maximum principle under certain regularity assumptions. However, the finite element implementation of the classical {Galerkin} formulation for both anisotropic and isotropic diffusions with decay does not respect the maximum principle. Put differently, the classical {Galerkin} formulation violates the discrete maximum principle ({DMP)} for diffusion with decay even on structured computational {meshes.We} first show that the numerical accuracy of the classical {Galerkin} formulation deteriorates dramatically with an increase in α for isotropic media and violates the {DMP.} However, in the case of isotropic media, the extent of violation decreases with the mesh refinement. We then show that, in the case of anisotropic media, the classical {Galerkin} formulation for anisotropic diffusion with decay violates the {DMP} even at lower values of decay coefficient and does not vanish with mesh refinement. We then present a methodology for enforcing maximum principles under the classical {Galerkin} formulation for anisotropic diffusion with decay on general computational grids using optimization techniques. Representative numerical results (which take into account anisotropy and heterogeneity) are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed formulation.

The same method can preserve the maximum principle for {DG} or finite volume schemes solving two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations in the vorticity stream-function formulation, or any passive convection equation with an incompressible velocity field. We also obtain positivity preserving (for density and pressure) high order {DG} or finite volume schemes solving compressible Euler equations on triangular meshes.

Phys. 229, 3091–3120 (doi:10.1016/j.jcp.2009.12.030)), genuinely high-order accurate finite volume and discontinuous {Galerkin} schemes satisfying a strict maximum principle for scalar conservation laws were developed. The main advantages of such schemes are their provable high-order accuracy and their easiness for generalization to multi-dimensions for arbitrarily high-order schemes on structured and unstructured meshes. The same idea can be used to construct high-order schemes preserving the positivity of certain physical quantities, such as density and pressure for compressible Euler equations, water height for shallow water equations and density for {Vlasov–Boltzmann} transport equations. These schemes have been applied in computational fluid dynamics, computational astronomy and astrophysics, plasma simulation, population models and traffic flow models. In this paper, we first review the main ideas of these maximum-principle-satisfying and positivity-preserving high-order schemes, then present a simpler implementation which will result in a significant reduction of computational cost especially for weighted essentially non-oscillatory finite-volume schemes.},

A general framework (for arbitrary order of accuracy) is established to construct a limiter for finite volume schemes (e.g. essentially non-oscillatory ({ENO)} or weighted {ENO} ({WENO)} schemes) or discontinuous {Galerkin} ({DG)} method with first order Euler forward time discretization solving one-dimensional scalar conservation laws. Strong stability preserving ({SSP)} high order time discretizations will keep the maximum principle. It is straightforward to extend the method to two and higher dimensions on rectangular meshes. We also show that the same limiter can preserve the maximum principle for {DG} or finite volume schemes solving two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations in the vorticity stream-function formulation, or any passive convection equation with an incompressible velocity field. Numerical tests for both the {WENO} finite volume scheme and the {DG} method are reported.},

They combine a special class of {{Runge}-{Kutta}} time discretizations, that allows the method to be non-linearly stable regardless of its accuracy, with a finite element space discretization by discontinuous approximations, that incorporates the ideas of numerical fluxes and slope limiters coined during the remarkable development of the high-resolution finite difference and finite volume schemes.

A review and a comparison of the most methods which have been proposed to remove or, at least, to diminish these oscillations without leading to excessive smearing of the layers are given in Part I, [V. John, P. Knobloch, On spurious oscillations at layers diminishing (SOLD) methods for convection–diffusion equations: Part I – A review, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 196 (2007) 2197–2215]. In the present paper, the most promising of these \{SOLD\} methods are investigated in more detail for P 1 and Q 1 finite elements. In particular, the dependence of the results on the mesh, the data of the problems and parameters of the methods are studied analytically and numerically. Furthermore, the numerical solution of the nonlinear discrete problems is discussed and the capability of adaptively refined grids for reducing spurious oscillations is examined. Our conclusion is that, also for simple problems, any of the \{SOLD\} methods generally provides solutions with non-negligible spurious oscillations. "
